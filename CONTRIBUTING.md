# Draw.io MCP Contributing guide

The project welcomes contributions but it is in the state of a hobby and experiment and therefore you have to be mindful about the implications.

There are no guidelines written down yet, therefore try to maintain the current code and documentation style.

When you consider contributing a feature or enhancement, please raise a [GitHub issue first](https://github.com/lgazo/drawio-mcp-server/issues), so we can coordinate the effort and build a plan before you spend valuable time writing code. 

Please avoid large PRs that combine multiple changes together and that would require extensive review, if possible. 

Feel free to suggest changes, but consult them upfront.

Help with testing and searching for interesting use-cases is more then welcomed.
